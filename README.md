# belly-button-challenge
# Objective: 
The following project allows us to utilize our knowledge of JavaScript, specifically the d3 library and Plotly, to create interactive visualizations. The benefit of this technique is to allow viewers to organise and dessiminate data and then for ease of access, can be made into deployable wesbites. In this github, you will find the link to my website, in which the graphs are created for the project.
